### Changes From Version 4.0

Guise 5.0 is not backwards-compatible with any previous version. The principle changes are these:

1. Containers have been eliminated as a separate type and are now just another `Hashable` parameter to the registration and resolution methods.
2. Caching has been simplified back to the state of affairs that existed in earlier versions. Instead of the complex lifecycles supported by version 4.0, there is only cached and not cached.
3. Names and containers can now be any `Hashable` type.
4. A set of `filter` overloads have been added which return arrays of keys. These can be used for resolving or unregistering _en masse_.
5. Arbitrary metadata can be passed during registration. This metadata can then be queried using the `filter` methods.
6. The signatures of the `register` and `resolve` overloads have been updated as needed.

### Usage

Before a dependency can be resolved, it must first be registered. Guise does not register dependencies directly. Instead, it registers blocks of type `(P) -> T`, where `P` is a parameter that can be supplied at resolution and `T` is the type of the actual dependency we wish to register. (Thanks to Swift's excellent type system, `P` can be `()`, i.e., `Void`, i.e., no parameter at all. This is the most common case.)

```swift
Guise.register{ AccountService() }
```

This registers the supplied block under the `AccountService` type, so if we ask Guise for the `AccountService`, this block will be called and its result returned:

```swift
let accountService = Guise.resolve()! as AccountService
```

#### Abstraction

Dependency resolution is most useful when it allows abstraction. This way different implementations can be swapped out as needed, whether at runtime or compile time.

```swift
#if TEST
let accountService = Guise.register{ MockAccountService() as AccountServicing }
#else
let accountService = Guise.register{ AccountService() as AccountServicing }
#endif
```

The return type of our resolution block `(P) -> T` is now the `AccountServicing` protocol, which both `AccountService` and `MockAccountService` implement. When resolving, we must specify this exact type:

```swift
let accountService = Guise.resolve()! as AccountServicing
```

#### Named Registrations

Registrations are recorded based on the type returned by the resolution block.

```swift
Guise.register{ AccountService() as AccountServicing }
Guise.register{ MockAccountService() as AccountServicing }
```

In this case, the second registration silently overwrites the first one. So how can two `AccountServicing` registrations be made?

```swift
Guise.register(name: "real") { AccountService() as AccountServicing }
Guise.registration(name: "mock") { MockAccountService() as AccountServicing }
```

We can then resolve the one we want quite easily.

```swift
let accountService = Guise.resolve(name: "real")! as AccountServicing
```

Any `Hashable` type can be used as a `name`.

```swift
enum Person { // Simple enumerations are hashable by default in Swift
case isabella
case miaoting
}
Guise.register(name: Person.isabella) { Person(name: "Isabella") }
```

#### Parameters

It is sometimes useful to pass a parameter when resolving, because the initializer of the registered type requires it.

```swift
Guise.register{ (size: Int) in Shoe(size) }
```

Resolution is straightforward:

```swift
let shoe = Guise.resolve(parameter: 9)! as Shoe
```

If `parameter` is not compatible with the type specified at registration, an unrecoverable runtime exception will occur.

But what if we need more than one parameter? This can be solved using any of the various structured types offered by Guise: tuples, arrays, dictionaries, structs, classes, and so on.

```swift
typealias AccountServiceParams = (url: String, foo: Int, bar: Float)
Guise.register{ (params: AccountServiceParams) in AccountService(url: params.url, foo: params.foo, bar: params.bar) as AccountServicing }
// Later
let accountService = Guise.resolve(parameter: (url: url, foo: 17, bar: 3.9))! as AccountServicing
```

#### Caching

By default, Guise does not cache. This means that the resolution block is called every time `resolve` is called. Guise can cache the result of the resolution block so that it is not needed again.

```swift
Guise.register(cached: true) { AccountService() }
```

The first time the block is resolved, Guise caches the result and all subsequent calls use this cached result. This can be overridden during resolution by passing an explicit value for `cached`.

```swift
let accountService = Guise.resolve(cached: false)! as AccountService
```

What happens if `cached: true` is passed during resolution when the block was not originally registered to be cached? Guise will cache the result anyway, but subsequent resolutions will still call the resolution block. However, the next time `cached: true` is passed when resolving, the cached value will be returned.

#### Registering Instances

A common case is to register an already-initialized instance rather than a resolution block. Guise has an overload to handle this case easily.

```swift
Guise.register(instance: AccountService() as AccountServicing)
```

This is exactly equivalent to the following:

```swift
let accountService = AccountService()
Guise.register(cached: true) { accountService as AccountServicing }
```

In fact, under the hood this is exactly what Guise does.

#### Containers

Registrations can be differentiated by placing them in containers. A container is simply another parameter that must be passed when registering and resolving. As with names, any `Hashable` type can be used.

```swift
enum Environment {
  case development
  case test
  case production
}
let accountService = Guise.register(instance: AccountService() as AccountServicing, container: Enviroment.test)
// Later, when resolving
let accountService = Guise.resolve(container: Environment.test)! as AccountServicing
```

Names and containers can be used together.

```swift
Guise.register(instance: Dog(name: "Fido"), name: Name.fido, container: Container.dogs)
let fido = Guise.resolve(name: Name.fido, container: Container.dogs)! as Dog
```

#### Keys

Every registration produces a `Key<T>`. This `Key<T>` uniquely identifies the registration, and any subsequent registration that would produce the same `Key` overwrites the previous one.

```swift
let key = Guise.register{ AccountService() as AccountServicing }
```

Each `Key<T>` records the registration's type (which is always the return type of the resolution block `(P) -> T`), `name`, and `container`. While type must always be specified, `name` and `container` default to `Name.default` if they are not given. The following two registrations are functionally identical:

```swift
let key = Guise.register{ AccountService() as AccountServicing }
let key = Guise.register(name: Name.default, container: Name.default) { AccountService() as AccountServicing }
```

Keys can be constructed directly, if desired.

```swift
let key = Key<AccountingService>name: Name.default, container: Name.default)
```

Guise actually has two closely related key types: `Key<T>` and `AnyKey`. `AnyKey` is a type-erased version of `Key<T>`, suitable for use in heterogeneous lists and a few other contexts. Conversion between the two is straightforward:

```swift
let key = Key<AccountService>()
let anykey = AnyKey(key)

// Key<T> has a failable initializer.
guard let key = Key<AccountService>(anyKey) else { return }
```

Sequences of `Key<T>` can be converted to `AnyKey` with the `untypedKeys` method. Sequences of `AnyKey` can be converted to `Key<T>` with the `typedKeys<T>` method. In the latter, any keys that do not contain the type `T` are simply omitted, so the number of keys returned by `typedKeys<T>` can be less than the number of the sequence upon which it is called.

In most cases, keys can be ignored. However, they are used in some scenarios:

- When unregistering.
- When searching for registrations using the `filter` methods, a collection of type `Set<Key<T>>` or `Set<AnyKey>` is returned.
- When performing multiple resolutions.

Each of these scenarios will be discussed below.

#### Metadata

Arbitrary metadata can be specified during registration. (Note that the default metadata is not `nil`, but `()`, i.e., an "instance" of `Void`).

```swift
let name = "Fido"
Guise.register(instance: Dog(name: name), name: name, metadata: 7)
```

To retrieve metadata, a `Key` must be used.

```swift
let key = Key<Dog>(name: "Fido", container: Name.default)
let metadata = Guise.metadata(for: key)! as Int
```

If there is no metadata for the `Key`, or if it is not of the specified type, `nil` is returned.

#### Filtering

Sometimes it is convenient to find all of the registrations matching some criteria. For instance, we might want to know all of the registrations in a certain container, or all of those registered under a certain type, or matching certain metadata, or any combination of these.

The overloads of the `filter` method can accomplish any of these tasks. The result is always a set of keys (i.e., `Set<Key<T>>` or `Set<AnyKey>`).

```swift
// Find all registrations in the default container
let keys = Guise.filter(container: Name.default)
// Find all registrations of this type in all containers with any name
let keys = Guise.filter(type: AccountServicing.self)
// Find all registrations of this type in the given container
let keys = Guise.filter(type: AccountServicing.self, container: Environment.test)
```

The `filter` method also accepts metadata queries. A metadata query is a block of type `(M) -> Bool`, where `M` is the type of the metadata as originally registered.

```swift
let keys = Guise.filter(type: Dog.self, container: Dogs.purebred) { (metadata: DogMetadata) in metadata.age < 1 }
```

To match this filter, the following must _all_ be true.

1. The registered type must be `Dog`.
2. The container must be `Dogs.purebred`.
3. The type of metadata must be `DogMetadata`.
4. The metadata query `metadata.age < 1` must return `true`.

Since `name` is not specified, it is ignored. Note that if a registration exists matching everything above, except that a different metadata type was used, i.e., `Int` instead of `DogMetadata`, it is simply ignored and not returned in the output.

The resulting `Set<Key>` can be used when unregistering, when performing multiple resolution, etc.

#### Single Resolution

Resolution has been discussed implicitly in many of the sections above. In order to resolve a dependency, Guise must have the following five pieces of information. All but the first are optional.

1. The type to be resolved.
2. The name of the registration. Defaults to `Name.default` if not specified.
3. The container of the registration. Defaults to `Name.default` if not specified.
4. The parameter to pass to the registration block. Defaults to `()` if not specified.
5. Whether or not to use a cached value. This is of type `Bool?` and defaults to `nil` if not specified, which means that the value specified when the registration was made will be used.

The return type of `resolve` is `T?`, i.e., either `resolve` returns the desired dependency or returns `nil` if no such dependency is registered. In most cases, dependencies are required for the proper functioning of an application, so forced unwrapping should be used.

```swift
// If no account service is registered, our application is simply invalid, so this should always succeed.
// Thus, it's safe to force-unwrap the result of resolve.
let accountService = Guise.resolve()! as AccountServicing
```

In the rare case where we need to test whether a registration exists, syntax similar to the following may be used.

```swift
guard let accountService = Guise.resolve(name: AccountService.funky) as AccountServicing? else { return }
```

#### Multiple Resolution

Given a `Set` of `Key<T>`, it is possible to resolve many dependencies of the same type at the same time.

```swift
let keys = Guise.filter<Dog>container: Container.dogs) // Set<Key<T>>
let dogs = Guise.resolve(keys: dogs) as [Dog]
// Or…
let dogs = Guise.resolve(keys: dogs) as [Key<Dog>: Dog]
```

### Thread Safety

Internally, Guise keeps registrations in a dictionary of type `[AnyKey: Dependency]`. `Dependency` is a private type that holds the resolution block, any cached values, related metadata, and so on. All operations on this dictionary are protected by a lock that allows one writer and multiple readers. Whenever possible, only operations specifically on this dictionary are locked. This means that resolution itself _does not_ occur inside of a lock. This is necessary both because resolution is inherently a more expensive operation than simple dictionary operations and to prevent a situation in which calling another Guise method inside of a resolution block could produce a deadlock.

The only exception is that metadata filters are called inside of a read lock. For this reason, it is important to keep metadata filters simple and brief.

### Dependency Injection vs Dependency resolution

Dependency injection is superior to dependency resolution. Resolution creates a dependency on the resolver itself. However, it is not possible to build a dependency injection framework given the current state of the Swift language. Much, much more powerful reflection and metadata capabilities would be needed, akin to those found in languages such as C#.
