/**
 A convenience type used in `filter` overloads.
 
 Its chief claim to fame is that the pattern match operator
 `~=` is defined such that a `Criteria` and a `Keyed` instance
 can be compared.
 
 Types are excluded because they are matched using the failable
 initializer of the `Keyed` protocol. (See the implementation of
 `filter` in the `Resolver` class.)
