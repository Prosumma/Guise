/**
 A resolver that does nothing. All calls to
 `resolve` return `nil`. All calls to `resolve(into:)`
 return the target unmodified.
 
 What's the point? In your unit tests, you may not want to
 use a resolver. You may want to set your dependencies manually
 either by setting properties or calling constructors explicitly.
 
 Consider a view controller which uses KeyPath injection. In
 `viewDidLoad` we call `resolve(into:)` to hydrate our dependencies:
 
 ```
 var api: Api! // A KeyPath dependency
 
 override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    Guise.resolve(into: self)
 }
 ```
 
 If we use the `ImpotentResolver`, the dependency won't be hydrated and
 we will have to set it manually, e.g.,
 
 ```
 Guise.resolver = ImpotentResolver()
 let vc = ViewController()
 _ = vc.view // Implicitly loads the view, calling viewDidLoad.
 vc.api = Api()
 ```

    /**
     Registers an injection.
     
     An injection is a function that transforms and then returns its argument. If the
     argument is a reference type, conforming injections must return the _same_ reference.
     If the injection does not apply to the passed-in instance, the instance should be
     returned unmodified.
     
     For example, here is a properly written injection that adds two to any integer passed to it.
     
     ```
     Guise.register(injectable: "AddTwo") { arg in
     guard let i = arg as? Int else { return arg }
     return i + 2
     }
     ```
     
     The first line of the injection is critically important. When `resolve` is called, every
     registered injection is tried. Those that do not apply will simply bail if properly written:
     
     ```
     var s = "ok"
     s = Guise.resolve(into: s)
     ```
     
     If our "AddTwo" injection was registered, it would simply return its argument.
     
     - note: Don't use this method. It is the foundation on which higher-level, more type-safe
     forms of injection are built.
     
     - parameter key: The unique key under which this injection is registered.
     - parameter injection: The injection to register.
     
     - returns: The key under which the registration was made.
