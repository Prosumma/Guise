/**
 The Guise type. Use its static methods.
 
 The most convenient way to use Guise is to use
 the static methods of the `Guise` type, e.g.,
 
 ```
 Guise.register(factory: Foo())
 ```
 
 The other way is simply to create a `Resolver` instance
 and pass it around, e.g.,
 
 ```
 let resolver = Resolver()
 resolver.register(factory: Foo())
 ```
 
 Under the hood, the `Guise` type does exactly this. It has
 a static `resolver` property which is initialized to the default
 resolver. All of its static methods simply forward to this
 resolver. It is possible to reassign this resolver, e.g.,
 
 ```
 Guise.resolver = ImpotentResolver()
 ```

    /**
     Registers an injection.
     
     An injection is a function that transforms and then returns its argument. If the
     argument is a reference type, conforming injections must return the _same_ reference.
     If the injection does not apply to the passed-in instance, the instance should be
     returned unmodified. An injection takes two parameters: The first is the target
     of the injection. The second is the resolver with which the injection is registered.
     
     For example, here is a properly written injection that adds two to any integer passed to it.
     In this example, we are ignoring the resolver passed as the second argument to the injection.
     
     ```
     Guise.register(injectable: "AddTwo") { (target, _) in
     guard let i = arg as? Int else { return arg }
     return i + 2
     }
     ```
     
     The first line of the injection is critically important. When `resolve` is called, every
     registered injection is tried. Those that do not apply will simply bail if properly written:
     
     ```
     var s = "ok"
     s = Guise.resolve(into: s)
     ```
     
     If our "AddTwo" injection was registered, it would simply return its argument.
     
     - warning: Don't use this method. It is the foundation on which higher-level, more type-safe
     forms of injection are built. Use any of the other overloads, but especially those
     that take keypaths.
     
     - parameter key: The unique key under which this injection is registered.
     - parameter injection: The injection to register.
     
     - returns: The key under which the registration was made.
