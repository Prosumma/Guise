/**
 The core of Guise.
 
 `Resolver` is the class that does all of Guise's heavy lifting.
 The `Guise` type uses an instance of `Resolver` under the hood
 and forwards all operations to it.
 
 In most cases, just use the static methods of the `Guise` type,
 but if you prefer, you can create a `Resolver` directly and
 simply use it:
 
 ```
 let resolver = Resolver()
 resolver.register(factory: Foo())
 ```

     Gets the registered keys.
     
     Keys are unique identifiers for block registrations.
     (Injections just use strings as keys.)
     
     This returns a `Set` of `AnyKey` instances, because
     the keys may register heterogeneous types.
     
     See `Keyed`, `AnyKey`, `Key<T>` and the various
     `register` overloads for more information on keys.

    /**
     Registers an injection.
     
     An injection is a function that transforms and then returns its argument. If the
     argument is a reference type, conforming injections must return the _same_ reference.
     If the injection does not apply to the passed-in instance, the instance should be
     returned unmodified. An injection takes two parameters: The first is the target
     of the injection. The second is the resolver with which the injection is registered.
     
     For example, here is a properly written injection that adds two to any integer passed to it.
     In this example, we are ignoring the resolver passed as the second argument to the injection.
     
     ```
     Guise.register(injectable: "AddTwo") { (target, _) in
         guard let i = arg as? Int else { return arg }
         return i + 2
     }
     ```
     
     The first line of the injection is critically important. When `resolve` is called, every
     registered injection is tried. Those that do not apply will simply bail if properly written:
     
     ```
     var s = "ok"
     s = Guise.resolve(into: s)
     ```
     
     If our "AddTwo" injection was registered, it would simply return its argument.
     
     - warning: Don't use this method. It is the foundation on which higher-level, more type-safe
     forms of injection are built. Use any of the other overloads, but especially those
     that take keypaths.
     
     - parameter key: The unique key under which this injection is registered.
     - parameter injection: The injection to register.
     
     - returns: The key under which the registration was made.
     */
