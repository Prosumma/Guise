     Creates a strong registration with Guise.
     
     It's probably best to use `register(instance:)` or `register(factory:)` instead of
     `register(strong:)`. This overload's chief claim to fame is that caching can be
     decided up front *and* during resolution:
     
     ```
     Guise.register(strong: Foo(), cached: true)
     ```
     
     Here we register a `Foo` and specify that it should be cached. This is almost
     exactly equivalent to `Guise.register(instance: Foo())` except that when resolving
     a registration made with `register(instance:)`, the cached value is *always* returned,
     even if the caller specifies `cached: false`. With `register(strong:)`, `cached: false`
     is honored.
     
     ```
     let foo = Guise.resolve(type: Foo.self, cached: false)
     ```
     
     If the above registration was made with `register(strong:)`, the resolution block
     will be called again even if the registration was made with `cached: true`. However,
     if the above registration was made with `register(instance:)`, the value of `cached`
     is ignored and the cached instance is always returned.
     
     Similar semantics apply to `register(factory:)`, but in reverse.
