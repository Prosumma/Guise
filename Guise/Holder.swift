/**
 A `Holder` holds a value and optionally
 provides caching semantics. Guise requires
 a `Holder` to be the return value of a
 registration block. If a `Holder` is not
 explicitly provided, the `Strong` holder
 will be used implicitly.
 
 The `Held` associated type is the type
 of the value held. Practically speaking,
 this means it is always the registered type.
 
 When a cached registration is made, it is
 actually the holder that is cached, not an
 instance of the underlying registered type.
 
 There are four implementations of `Holder`
 in Guise: `Strong` (the default), `Weak`,
 `Cached` and `Uncached`. See their documentation.
