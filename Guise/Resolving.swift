    /**
     Registers an injection.
     
     An injection is a function that transforms and then returns its argument. If the
     argument is a reference type, conforming injections must return the _same_ reference.
     If the injection does not apply to the passed-in instance, the instance should be
     returned unmodified. An injection takes two parameters: The first is the target
     of the injection. The second is the resolver with which the injection is registered.
     
     For example, here is a properly written injection that adds two to any integer passed to it.
     In this example, we are ignoring the resolver passed as the second argument to the injection.
     
     ```
     Guise.register(injectable: "AddTwo") { (target, _) in
         guard let i = arg as? Int else { return arg }
         return i + 2
     }
     ```
     
     The first line of the injection is critically important. When `resolve` is called, every
     registered injection is tried. Those that do not apply will simply bail if properly written:
     
     ```
     var s = "ok"
     s = Guise.resolve(into: s)
     ```
     
     If our "AddTwo" injection was registered, it would simply return its argument.
     
     - warning: Don't use this method. It is the foundation on which higher-level, more type-safe
     forms of injection are built. Use any of the other overloads, but especially those
     that take keypaths.
     
     - parameter key: The unique key under which this injection is registered.
     - parameter injection: The injection to register.
     
     - returns: The key under which the registration was made.
