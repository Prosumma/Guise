/**
 The protocol which all keys must implement.
 
 Registrations are always made by key. A subsequent
 registration made under the same key silently
 overwrites a previous registration.
 
 A key records three facts about a registration: its type
 (as a `String`), name, and container. These facts are
 supplied at registration using either a key directly
 or one of the convenience overloads. `name` and `container`
 default to `Guise.Name.default` and `Guise.Container.default`
 respectively.
 
 A `Keyed` can be converted to another `Keyed` with the
 failable initializer supplied by this protocol. The
 initializer never fails in a type-erased `Keyed` implementation
 (i.e., `AnyKey`) but will fail for a type-safe `Keyed`
 implementation (i.e., `Key<RegisteredType>`) if the types
 are not compatible.
